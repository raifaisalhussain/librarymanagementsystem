This file provides guidance to run Standalone or Client-Server Library Management System.

Standalone Application:
Execute below scripts in terminal to compile library system in case library_system.exe file doesn't exist or not working properly.

g++ -o library_system Main.cpp Book.cpp User.cpp Library.cpp LibraryItems.cpp Transaction.cpp LibraryManager.cpp -std=c++17 -pthread -lws2_32

Then run application with below script:  
./library_system

Client-Server Application:
Execute below scripts in terminal to compile server in case server.exe file doesn't exist or not working properly.

g++ -o server MainServer.cpp Server.cpp Book.cpp User.cpp Library.cpp LibraryItems.cpp Transaction.cpp LibraryManager.cpp -std=c++17 -pthread -lws2_32

Then run server with below script:  
./server

Client connects with server using a specified IP address which is configured in MainClient.cpp file
Replace IP address in MainClient.cpp file with IP address shown in terminal when server started.

Save the file and recompile the client program with below command:

g++ -o client MainClient.cpp Client.cpp -std=c++17 -pthread -lws2_32

Run client with below command in terminal:

./client
